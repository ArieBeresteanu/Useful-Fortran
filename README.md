# Useful-Fortran

I am going to put here modules with useful Fortran functions and subroutines. Some of them are adapted from other sources and I hope I am giving the right and full credit. Most of them I wrote myself. I have no guarantee for quality or accuracy and I bet some of them can be written in a better way. Please send me your comments (arie@pitt.edu). The code is written in Fortran 90/95.
